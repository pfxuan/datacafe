# This file is given as a sample for creating a Data Cafe Hazelcast cluster.
# To be able to read these properties, make sure to move these properties to the datacafe.properties file.

hazelcastXml=conf/hazelcast.xml

# Name of the execution cluster. Default is "main". Change this for parallel simulations.
# Uncomment and use different cluster names for multi-tenanted deployments.
mainCluster=main
# mainCluster2=main2
# mainCluster3=main3

# Name of the supportive cluster. Default is "sub". Change this for parallel Supporter clusters.
# The cluster used for scaling and health decisions.
# Example use case: IntelligentAdaptiveScaler.
subCluster=sub


## Health-Monitor properties
# Mention timeBetweenHealthChecks property along with the params,
# to enable health checking.
timeBetweenHealthChecks=10
## Params
#highThresholdProcessCpuLoad=0.15
#lowThresholdProcessCpuLoad=0.02
#

#### Auto Scaler properties
#maxNumberOfInstancesToBeSpawned=3
###in seconds
#timeBetweenScalingDecisions=60
##mode: auto - for scaling up.
## adaptive - for adding existing instances adaptively into
## the execution cluster, based on the load.
#scalingMode=adaptive
