use hdfs.root;

alter session set `store.format`='json';

create table dfs.tmp.drill_output_1242 as SELECT columns[0] as SUBJECT_ID, columns[1] as HADM_ID, columns[2] as OUTCOME FROM hdfs.root.`admissions_admissionsData.csv` WHERE columns[3]='';


Output files in /tmp/drill_output folder.

Hence the decision to write to a json file.
